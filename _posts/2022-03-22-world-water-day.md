Do you know where your city gets its water supply from? A local river, reservoir, groundwater or somewhere else?  On this [World Water Day 2022](https://www.worldwaterday.org/) I am launching **‘Paani ka Maanchitra - WaterMap’**: an initiative to increase awareness on where cities get their water from.

[The first WaterMap is of Ahmedabad, India.](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c1e5a2f367c84441a4b932c88f3aaff0?header) I envision this initiative as a crowd sourced database of WaterMaps for cities across the world! I invite you all to explore the water sources and water supply infrastructure in your city and create a WaterMap.

**Contact me** (surecities@gmail.com) for scheduling a workshop on how to make WaterMaps.
Join me in making our present and future more water secure!
